							<div class="singular_information"><p class="s_information">Without being too cheesy, welcome to my life, the good, the bad and the awful.  This blog page will be my life in writing, my struggles, my achievements, ups and downs and even fortune tellers, but that will be covered later in this post. Hopefully more positivity than anything else. So, I guess where to start? My name is Connor Duthie, I am 26 years of age, writing for a degree in Web Design and Development. Originally from Aberdeen but you will have to check out my other posts for that story. Without going in to too much detail, I was a socially awkward secondary student, without an incline as to what I wanted to do or be in life. Quite often than not, school pushes you to decide on a career, one that you will spend the next 10 years working towards. I was often stuck picking subjects based solely on how much the starting salary was, only to then realise that I hated the subject in its entirety, which to this day has resulted in my qualifications looking like I had picked them all from a tombola. While art and design were what interested me, I was often told and read that it was a difficult subject regarding finding a job afterwards. So not wanting to leave school without a back-up plan, I scoured through a college brochure of courses and picked one at random, a course that just happened to have been done by my brother. Introduction to Service Engineering was the course and while my brother had nothing but dislike and negative comments to say about it.</p></div>

							<div class="singular_information"><p class="s_information">I however went in with an open mind, as everyone has different likes and dislikes about, as I thought that this could be the course of my dreams. Well ladies and gentlemen it would appear that my brother was right, I disliked it extremely. Firstly, the location was in the middle of nowhere as it was an agricultural college and secondly it just failed to grab my attention. I ended up not finishing the course and went into full time work, we shall skip forward to when I was working in the morning as a “Bacterial Hygienist” or better known as a domestic assistant at the NHS sick children hospital. It was this part of my life that I had been working for nearly 2 years since leaving service engineering. My job was that of a relief post, I would be placed in areas where members of staff were off sick or on holiday, it was from there where a lady who worked I worked with upped and left without a moment notice. This resulted in me covering her area indefinitely, while I did not complain at first it was only when I was in my second month of covering this area that I began to dislike it. Within this area consists of several toilets for people to use, but none were as bad as the four main reception area toilets, they were always left in a dire state from the night before. After two months of covering this area and amid cleaning one of these four toilets I had enough. I sat down in the middle of this toilet area on the floor (I know disgusting) and contemplated life.</p></div>

							<div class="singular_information"><p class="s_information">While everyone that I worked with and my supervisors and management were all nice towards me, I was still left feeling dissatisfied, feeling as though I should be working at a job that I enjoy and not one that would have me cleaning the mess of others up. It was here I decided to take up college again but this time I assigned more thought into what I would like to do for the rest of my life. This was where I stumbled upon the course Introduction to Digital Media, it consisted of; Game Development, Web Development, Photo Editing and Video Editing. It had a number of subjects that I could try and see whether they would entice me. Although it was at this point where I was still deciding whether I would still be going back to college and whether I should consider other courses. It was from there where I was approached by my supervisor, she spoke to me about how she was a fortune teller when she was younger and continued to do so but less frequently up until that point. She told me how she knew I was thinking of going to college and that the course I had picked initially was one that I should pursue as she could forsee me being successful with it and that I would own an expensive black car. This was the final push I needed to apply for that course and as a result is the reason why I am here in my final year at Edinburgh Napier University. While I still don't have that expensive black car, I am in my final year and still determined to pursue this subject as a career.</p></div>
